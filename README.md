Greetings!

Welcome to PESUECC's official text-based RPG, "Navigating PES"! 

Do you have what it takes to survive life as a freshman in PES? Each increasing in difficulty, can you make it past the 5 ISAs? And then battle the dreaded ESA? Or will you string together enough bad performances to accumulate a backlog? Find out as you dive deep into the world of your average engineering student. 

With exclusive access to venues in the campus, you can replenish your HP with `food and ale from the Pixel Block`. Or perhaps equip yourself with weapons to battle the tests at the `Armoury of the 4th and 5th Floor`. And if neither place provides what you're looking for, seek wisdom by acquiring `The Holy Book of Blue` at the `Stationary Bazaar`. However, none of this will be possible if you forget your ID card and fail to make it past the `security guard and his two sentinel-like bouncers`.
